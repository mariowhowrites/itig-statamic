The Third Way immigration platform is built around incentives that perfectly align the interests of all stakeholders in the immigration debate. In return for paying into America's tax system, immigrants will be afforded protections and liberties unknown under their present legal condition. This ensures immigrant safety and the absolute minimization of burden to taxpayers, creating a win-win situation in which America once again embraces its role as the world's foremost guarantor of opportunity.
