How Immigrant Tax Inquiry Group Proposes A Solution for U.S. Immigration Issues
==


Immigrant Tax Inquiry Group (ITIG) identified six problems with our current immigration system.  We explain present immigration issues and then offer solutions for each existing challenge. The ITIG goal is to create a viable immigration reform entity that benefits American citizens and undocumented immigrants alike.

The Problems 
-
* Eleven million undocumented workers living in poverty, fear violent acts, arrest, and deportation.
* Five million immigrant employees pay taxes with other peoples Social Security Numbers (SSNs).
* Undocumented immigrants file fraudulent tax returns using an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN).
* Every year the government loses $4.2 billion because they consider ITIN users to be independent contractors.
* Social Security and Medicare funds are being exhausted by illegal immigrants.
* American taxpayers unjustly pay for undocumented immigrants’ public services.

The Answers:
-
* Instate a ten-year Special Work Permit.
* Establish a five percent Public Service worker tax and a five percent Public Service Employer Tax to pay for the * privileges of the ten-year Special Work Permit.
* The IRS receives increased revenue to fund states.
* States distribute funds to appropriate jurisdictions for education, community centers, government services, healthcare, and correctional programs.

Losses and Gains:
-
* Employers give up a five percent Public Service Tax based on employee’s income
* Employers gain dedicated, healthy, and happy legal workers
* Employers continue to capture netsavings on their payroll
* Two bad (ITIN and Nanny) unmanageable taxes are replaced by one efficient, accountable tax.

Benefits for Employers

* It allows employers to legally hire undocumented workers.
* Employer receives lower cost workers who are dedicated to their job.
* Employers gain dedicated, healthy, and satisfied, legal workers, and that means more productivity.
* There would be no risk of jail time or large fines hiring illegal workers.
* Employers continue to capture net savings on their payroll.
* Two poor unmanageable taxes (ITIN and nanny tax) are replaced by one efficient, accountable tax.
