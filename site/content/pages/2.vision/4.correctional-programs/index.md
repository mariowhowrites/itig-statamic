Funding for Correctional Programs
-
Early intervention and understanding are critical factors in preventing juvenile delinquency. A number of different programs currently exist and the more efficient ones are those that intervene before the onset of delinquent behavior and prevent that behavior. These programs are of particular value to the general public because they may stop the crime from happening in the first place. The success of these programs is due to the fact that they target specific risk factors that are known to lead to delinquent behavior.

* Our plan will provide a revenue stream to fund successful programs that nip these problems in the bud causing a positive domino effect and eliminating some of the reasons young people end up in our prisons, burdening the taxpayer.

Criminal Retention
-
Violent crime and drug distribution and possession are prevalent among unauthorized immigrants. Over 25 percent of today’s federal prison population are undocumented immigrants. The overall financial impact of illegal alien crimes is billions of dollars per year. Factor in the crime as a result of cocaine and other drugs being smuggled in and the numbers are higher. About 60 percent of the crimes being committed by illegal aliens are ones committed by those who were previously deported.

The media feeds us repeated stories on crimes committed by prisoners who were released from prison before they served their full sentences. In L.A., for example, certain overcrowded county jails were accelerating their release of selected prisoners who had already served at least half their terms and were guilty of nonviolent crimes.

* Our plan would provide more experienced teachers and trainers in retention, especially for those incarcerated individuals who are less responsive to established programs. Our goal is to provide the resources to ensure the safety of the general public by allocating funds to the prison system for the expansion of current facilities (or build new ones) to accommodate the overload of prisoners, and to provide sufficient staff to monitor and supervise their behavior and promote the reduction of early release prisoners.

Gang Intervention
-
In order to combat gang activity, ‘social intervention’ strategies utilize outreach and counseling programs designed to prevent gang delinquency, reduce gang membership, or re-channel gang activity into more constructive pursuits. ‘Opportunity programs,’ which may include job training, provision of employment, and educational programs designed to attack the causes of gang involvement and delinquency. ‘Organizational development and change,’ which is designed to make law enforcement and social service agencies more effective in their respective tasks is another approach to discourage gang involvement.

* Our plan includes funding for job training, after-school activities, and additional hands-on programs through community centers, and our strategies will go a long way toward supporting gang intervention and even preventing delinquency at its root.
