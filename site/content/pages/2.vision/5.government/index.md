Homeland Security
-
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), was created in the wake of the 9/11 attacks on the Twin Towers in New York City, the Pentagon, and Pennsylvania, to defend our country and its protectorates from another terrorist attack or natural disaster or man-made accident. The stated goal of the DHS is to prepare for, prevent, and respond to domestic emergencies, particularly terrorism. Its scope includes border securityâ€”land, maritime and country borders. The DHS has absorbed the Immigration and Naturalization Service and assumed its duties. In doing so, it divided the enforcement and services functions into two separate and new agencies: Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Citizenship and Immigration Services. Most of us are aware of the invasion of not only those undocumented immigrants who are not criminals, but also those involved with dangerous drug cartels that are establishing bases in many American cities.

* Our plan is to allocate five billion dollars to help close our southern borders and to augment our military and law enforcement personnel in order to guarantee safety for those serving to protect our borders, and the citizens living within them.

Internal Revenue Service Administration

Rather than have Congress prepare the recommended tax code changes in this report, it is suggested that the IRS design it. In order to avoid political influence, we propose that it include a civilian review element.

* Our plan allows for the IRS to perform its normal function of tax administration, collection and reporting, and responsible for allocating funds to states, based on immigrant population.
