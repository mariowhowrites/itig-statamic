Irrespective of the outcome of the much hyped Immigration Reform Bill in the United States, sentiments run high about the danger of political expediency in legalizing a large population which has nothing substantial to contribute to the economy. There is also concern whether the Bill is becoming a pawn in the hands of Democrats and Republicans in the game of one-upman ship. Both are harboring a consensus that the immigration system is broken and needs a fixing.

In between the political divide there seem to be lobbies that want to have their way and is regrettably short sighted at the damage being caused to the social fabric.

Problems and Prospects
-
Just as any coin has two sides, the debate on illegal immigration pros and cons. This is truer about the vexed illegal immigration which is now an emotional issue. It calls for objectivity to analyze dispassionately the illegal immigrations pros and cons.

Mere love for America and claim as a Good Samaritan is not enough for that. Keep it aside for a while. The approach must be good will for oneâ€™s own prosperity and a concern for the uplift of the repressed immigrants who may be a poor neighbor.

Different Stands
-
The Republicans stand for shutting off the world, while Democrats want masses to come in. But Republicans are being made to look like bad guys and the Democrats seem weak on defense. In either case, it is all smoke. One wants to look the other side bad so that the sentiments can be used well in an election.

The debate on illegal immigration pros and cons yields the following first hand results,

Main Pros and Cons
==
Pros: Immigrant makes money in America and send to family.
-
* Business gets cheap labor
* Business can escape paying taxes
* Business can spare the pay for health care
* Business not to contend with OSHA
* Elite Americans can save money on maids, babysitting and lawn care.
Cons
-
* America loses tax money.
* American schools lapse funds teaching kids of illegal immigrants.
* Middle- and lower class native Americans lose jobs to these aliens
* Hospitals come under pressure by way of free treatment to illegals
* English suffers as nation engrosses in bilingual debate.
* Lack of control on criminals and terrorists who cross the border
* Higher crime rate
* Patently Unscientific

Granting illegal aliens amnesty can increase tax revenue. But the costs would also increase as illegals would access many programs that are currently off limits to them. Direct costs for programs like the Earned Income Tax Credit would also grow with legalization. Illegals only need a Social Security number to file a tax return to get the credit. From a fiscal point of view, legalization would sanctify unskilled legal immigrants. And unskilled legal immigrants create larger fiscal costs than unskilled illegal aliens.

The stamp of legalization will not change the low education or the limitations of the American labor market to such workers whatever their legal status. United States has a well-developed welfare state that provides assistance to low-income workers. Ultimately large fiscal costs will be an unavoidable outcome of unskilled immigration given the economic realities of America today.
