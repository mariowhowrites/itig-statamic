When people understand that the Immigrant Tax Inquiry Group (ITIG) plan is funded by a small tax on salaries paid by the undocumented workers’ employers, there are questions: “Will the employers pay?” and “Won’t we be flooded with new illegal immigrants?”

And the simple answers are, “Yes,” employers will pay, and “No,” we will most likely not be flooded with new illegal immigrants.

Employers want to stay within the law. This proposal provides a simple and routine way for employers to pay the small tax obligation for their previously illegal employees, while cleaning up the government records muddied by undocumented workers who have been using others’ Social Security numbers. Homeowners will no longer be obligated to pay the difficult-to-calculate 18% Nanny Tax and cell phone technology makes payments effortless. No more company raids and jail time. Employers will experience a positive change in their workforce–grateful workers with benefits, who are now being treated with respect and dignity. A symbiotic relationship has been created.

A flood of new unlawful immigrants would be unlikely. Rather, employer and employee relationships will be formed.  Under this plan, verification of the status of the immigrants being hired is easier–and hiring illegals would be a greater risk since those with the Special Work Permits would be legally entitled to those jobs.

This plan generates $100 billion over ten years. The many benefits this amount funds, will manifest in a content, healthy, stable and more productive work force living in dynamic communities. Farmers will have a secure, stronger healthy labor force at no medical cost to them–landscapers, maids and construction workers alike will no longer be “living in the shadows.”

Pew Research records that undocumented workers are paid 25% less than legal immigrants, so how could “line up and pay taxes” possibly succeed? Tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants “game” our tax system for $42 billion every ten years (equal to the taxes paid by six million American taxpayers). If the cash economy continues to be allowed to file as “independent contractors,” Social Security and Medicare disbursements for “self-employed” immigrants (if they were granted citizenship at this time) would be exorbitant–a payout ratio of between 7:1 to 15:1 (between $7 and $15 for every $1 paid in) from someone declaring only $9,000 on their tax return.

Is the worker worth the 5-10% it will take to cover benefits for them and other Americans? Employers will be required to pay the tax but have the not encouraged option  of deducting all or part of it from the immigrant’s wages, most likely based on the quality of their work. This will be up to the employer and unregulated, but workers will have the right to turn down a “splitter” (an employer who splits the cost with the immigrant) and work for someone else who will pay the slight premium.
This is a transitional proposal–citizenship set aside for now–that will solve the immediate issue of providing funds needed for immigration reform. This is also a cultural paradigm shift reminiscent of how society accepted non-smoking regulations–first we ignored it, then we got used to it–now we demand it.

There are a growing number of people (now 230 million) who live removed from their place of origin for various reasons such as job insecurity, wars and climate change. We, as a nation, take in the majority of these people. As a powerful world leader, and as a country of immigrants, we have the obligation to help solve this problem in the highest tradition of our international responsibilities.

Whatever the approach, it should be humane, moral, responsible, and recognize the intrinsic dignity of the individual. We believe our plan meets those criteria.
